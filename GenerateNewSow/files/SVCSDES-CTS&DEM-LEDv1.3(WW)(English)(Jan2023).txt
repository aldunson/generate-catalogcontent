Description of the services

Microsoft will partner with the Customer in an Azure migration and
modernization effort. This partnership is in the form of an Azure
migration program with the objective to migrate and operationalize up to
the scoped number of applications and databases over the stated program
length. This program is designed with considerable flexibility to drive
migration velocity across a broad set of environments and applications
and includes the foundational activities of building out the landing
zone, applying Microsoft best-practice security controls, and operations
and governance. The details of the services provided are in the
following sections.

Any dates provided for Microsoft are estimates only.

Customer-desired business outcomes

This section cannot be left blank or have the outcomes indicated as to
be determined (TBD). At a minimum, the overall business value to be
delivered should be conveyed here. In defining outcomes, it is a balance
between clarity (agree on where we are headed) and measurement (so that
we understand if we are moving in the right direction of the desired
outcomes).

At the end of the engagement, the agreed outcome will be assessed
jointly with the Customer.

Ideally, when filling in this section, do not go into more detail than
epics and features. The focus is on business functional needs. A full
list of detailed user stories should not be used here because it can
create the expectation of a fixed scope, as in, all the user stories
will be delivered as part of this engagement.

The Customer has expressed the desire to obtain the following business
outcomes. The agile delivery approach (described in the Engagement
Delivery Approach section of the attached Engagement Delivery Approach
(EDA)) allows the Customer to continually adjust and adapt the outcomes
and direction of any solutions designed to reach said outcomes.
Microsoft will continue its efforts based on the priorities and
direction provided by the Customer until such time as all capacity has
been consumed.

If more capacity is needed to deliver the desired business outcomes or
if additional outcomes need to be defined, the change management process
described in the attached EDA will be followed to increase capacity.

Phases, services, and products

Phases

Using the agile delivery approach, sprints are implemented in three
broad engagement phases: Prepare, Pilot, and Migrate. These phases are
illustrated in the following diagram.

Choose the image based on the assigned customer complexity in OSE.

Option 1: Customer Complexity = Simple:

[This graphic depicts Option 1, Customer Complexity = Simple. There are
three phases: Prepare, Pilot, and Migrate. The activities associated
with each of the phases is shown and discussed in the text that
follows.]

Option 2: Customer Complexity = Medium or Complex:

[This graphic depicts Option 2, Customer Complexity = Medium or Complex.
There are three phases: Prepare, Pilot, and Migrate. The activities
associated with each of the phases is shown and discussed in the text
that follows.]

Prepare phase

The Prepare phase consists of a series of parallel sprints that will be
used to:

-   Align on an end-to-end migration process that combines technical,
    operational, and business activities. These parallel sprints will
    also be used for tooling, intake and application disposition with
    backlog refinement, and the automation required for a successful
    migration program. This will produce a pilot-ready version 0.1 of
    the Azure migration playbook in Microsoft Azure DevOps, the initial
    cloud catalog of discovered assets, and the baseline velocity plan.

  Add the following if customer complexity is medium or complex in OSE

-   Validate key processes and tooling with a migration proof of
    concept.

  Choose one:

-   Design and implement an Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

-   Remediate an existing Azure Landing Zone (ALZ).

-   Design and implement an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) landing zone
    for containerized applications.

-   Align the Customer’s IT operating model to the Microsoft Cloud
    Adoption Framework.

-   Mobilize key Customer stakeholders to achieve migration velocity.

If the Prepare phase (only) has already been delivered in a previous
engagement add the following:

The Prepare phase was previously delivered in [Engagement name] and the
outputs from that engagement will be used to drive the current project.

Pilot phase

The Pilot phase consists of a series of parallel sprints taking a set of
selected applications and completing the activities in the migration
playbook. Include the following when the Pilot phase has been extended
in OSE: The Pilot phase’s intake and application disposition activities
have been extended to drive the creation of a deeper backlog of
applications to be migrated. The Customer and Microsoft will use the
feedback obtained during this phase to review and agree on upgrades to
the migration playbook. This phase will end with a revised,
migration-ready version 1.0 of the Azure migration playbook.

If the Prepare and Pilot phases have already been delivered in a
previous engagement add the following:

The Prepare and Pilot phases were previously delivered in [Engagement
name] and the outputs from that engagement will be used to drive the
current project.

If the Pilot phase has not been delivered and is not in scope, add the
following:

The Pilot phase is not in scope and may be delivered in a future
engagement.

Migrate phase

The Migrate phase consists of parallel sprints running the defined
migration playbook across applications and business units at scale to
achieve velocity in the migration program. The initial, assumed scope
for this phase is listed below. This phase may lead to the
identification of needed improvements that will be reviewed and added to
the migration playbook through a defined governance process. During this
phase, scale feature teams may be added, based on the application
backlog and the limits defined in the Program size and timeline section.

If the Migrate is not in scope, add the following:

The Migrate phase is not in scope and may be delivered in a future
engagement.

Services

Microsoft plans to deliver the following services during sprints in the
phases noted based on the prioritized backlog. While the program uses an
initial set of assumptions to help size each service, actual migration
and modernization strategy assignments will be done during application
and database intake and assessment, based on Customer and technical
needs, which may vary from the following tables. To achieve the
migration and modernization in the time frames stated below, it will
require the active participation of [Customer name] IT, business
application owners, and executive sponsors during the project. Actual
services delivered will be governed by the prioritized product backlog
that will evolve throughout the engagement. If scope changes result in a
resourcing or duration adjustment, the program’s change management
process as described in the EDA will be followed.

Foundation services

Use information from the Inputs tab of the OSE estimator that was used
to structure the project to fill out the section below.

Modernization Support Services (MSS)

The goal of MSS is to provide architecture reviews, create IaC
deployment resources, and facilitate IaaS management services in support
of both Microsoft and Customer-led migrations.

Post-Migration Support

All migration scope includes post-migration support by the migration
factory for 10 business days. Post-migration support starts at MAT
handoff and is signaled by submission of the MAT acceptance form to the
Customer. Post-migration support covers the following MAT, cutover, and
post-cutover scenarios.

-   During MAT: Help the Customer resolve migration-related issues.

-   Following MAT acceptance of production environments:

-   Provide guidance to the Customer during post-MAT cutover, if
      required.

-   Provide guidance to the Customer that addresses migration-related
      problems reported to Microsoft after MAT acceptance.

-   Following MAT acceptance of nonproduction environments: Support the
    Customer in order to resolve migration-related problems reported to
    Microsoft after MAT acceptance.

-   Following post-migration support: The Customer will be solely
      responsible for resolving any problems not reported during
      post-migration support. The Customer can choose to fund extended
      post-migration support for applications which meet specific
      criteria from a dedicated Microsoft team using “flexible hours
      allocation.”

-   Hypercare support for server migration: Provide 30 days of virtual
      machine monitoring support after post-migration support ends.

-   Flexible hours allocation: As opportunities are identified to
      further drive Azure consumption toward Customer targets, Microsoft
      and the Customer will jointly review and approve hours from the
      flexible hours allocation pool of hours. These flexible hours can
      be applied to tasks that will drive workloads to Azure. [Flexible
      Factory Hours] flexible hours have been added to the program.

    1.  Product definitions

The program will deliver the products defined below based on the
prioritized backlog:

-   ALZ is a product and the Customer’s OKRs will be defined during
    product baseline planning.

-   WLZ-AKS is a product and the Customer’s OKRs will be defined during
    product baseline planning.

-   AMS and all servers and applications that move through it are a
    product and follow a shared set of OKRs with specific application
    OKRs handled only on an exception basis. OKRs will be defined during
    the Prepare phase.

-   ARS and all applications that move through it are a product and
    follow a shared set of OKRs with specific application OKRs handled
    only on an exception basis. OKRs will be defined during the Prepare
    phase.

-   ATS treats each application as a separate product with distinct OKRs
    defined during each application’s individual product baseline
    planning.

-   CMS and all applications that move through it follow a shared set of
    OKRs with specific application OKRs handled only on an exception
    basis. OKRs will be defined during the Prepare phase.

-   DMS and all databases that move through it are a product and follow
    a shared set of OKRs with specific database OKRs handled only on an
    exception basis. OKRs will be defined during the Prepare phase.
    Dependencies with applications moving through AMS, ARS, and CMS may
    exist.

Velocity and application pipeline planning 

Velocity planning

During the Prepare phase, Microsoft and the Customer will build a view
of the aggregate number of applications and databases planned to be
migrated or modernized over each sprint remaining in the engagement. The
view represents the baseline velocity plan for the rates of migration
and modernization of the applications and databases; it does not
identify specific applications or databases—only an aggregate count.
Microsoft and the Customer will use this information to review and
adjust capacity and duration as needed. During the Pilot and Migrate
phases, the velocity plan will be updated and reviewed with the
prioritized backlog, initially after every application and database
move, and as the engagement progresses, monthly to adjust resourcing or
duration as needed. If the resourcing or duration adjustment requires a
formal change request, the engagement’s change management process as
described in the EDA will be followed.

Application pipeline planning

Microsoft and the Customer will conduct application pipeline planning
during mutually agreed-upon time frames, to develop the pipeline for the
program. The program is broken into a multiple series of migration
sprints called migration waves. The number of migration waves will be
mutually agreed to during the Prepare phase.

The Customer will be responsible for the identification of the pipeline
of applications. Starting in the Pilot phase, the Customer agrees to
maintain a monthly minimum threshold of <Intake Velocity in OSE>
applications and their associated databases for the intake assessment
backlog. This threshold will be reviewed on a weekly basis. The Customer
will also provide to Microsoft, the prioritization of the applications
included in the pipeline. The pipeline will provide key preliminary
information about the applicable applications, such as contacts for
Customer application owners and any known interfacing applications.

For the applications included in the pipeline, Microsoft will then start
the creation of the migration plan, which will include understanding
application affinity or which applications must migrate together and
defining those bundles. Microsoft will engage Customer business owners
to align the migration plan in accordance with business owner inputs
regarding application complexity and criticality, business disruption
impact, business owner/application owner availability, and
legal/regulatory impacts. Microsoft’s migration process will include
defining migration bundles (move groups), sequencing the bundles, and
aligning bundles according to the planned migration wave schedule.

Once the pipeline planning is complete and approved by the Customer, it
will be incorporated into the migration wave plan.

Program size and timeline

If you need to include a staffing plan (text in blue), please refer to
guidance in the Deal Shaping & Pricing Guide for suggestions on how to
create the plan.

The maximum resource capacity and months available by phase are shown in
the following table. Feature teams will be staffed within these limits.
For details, please review the staffing plan that is referenced in the
Attachments section.

Update the tables below with information from OSE / CompassOne.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Engagement phase        Duration   Resources
                          (months)   
  ----------------------- ---------- -------------------------------------
  Prepare                 3          Up to 35 resources

  Pilot                   2          Up to 43 resources

  Migrate                 20         Up to 56 resources

  Hypercare support end   1          
  month                              

  Total                   26         
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maximum defined capacity of <total hours from OSE> hours can be
flexibly handled based on the prioritized backlog across the individual
services and can also be moved between phases, provided that the maximum
defined capacity is not exceeded.

Along with the resources noted above, the feature teams also use factory
capacity to handle planning and migration activities. The total
application and database factory fees are located in the Fees section of
this WO.

The timeline for this engagement is relative to the engagement start
date. The start date for the engagement will be based on a mutually
agreed-upon timeline when key project startup prerequisites are
completed. All dates and durations provided are estimates only. The
specific timeline will be finalized during product baseline planning and
will be updated as part of core engagement planning activities.

We will provide the Microsoft team described in the EDA, Engagement
organization section, for a period not to exceed <total months from OSE>
or until the capacity defined above is consumed.

The high-level timeline of the engagement is depicted in the following
image.

[igh-Level Engagement Timeline The image shows five horizontal lanes or
rows that depict the relative start dates of each phase. The first row
is engagement initiation which starts when the engagement starts. The
second row is product baseline planning which starts after engagement
initiation and completes before the next phase starts. The third row is
the prepare phase of delivery sprints. The row depicts 1 or more sprints
each in succession. The fourth row is the Pilot Phase of delivery
sprints. The pilot phase begins when the prepare phase ends and has one
or more sprints each in succession. The last row is the migrate phase of
delivery sprints. They migrate phase starts at the conclusion of the
pilot phase and contains one or more sprints each in succession. Upon
the completion of the migrate phase, the engagement ends.]

Note: Sprint implementation may be concurrent across these workstreams
and will be addressed in the engagement communications plan for clarity.

Program completion

Microsoft will provide the services described previously during the
period of performance defined in this Work Order (WO). If additional
services are required, the engagement’s change management process
described in the EDA will be followed, and the contract will be
modified. The engagement will be considered complete when at least one
of the following conditions have been met:

-   The available capacity has been consumed.

-   All Microsoft activities and product backlog items have been
    completed.

-   The WO has been terminated.

Due to the nature of the Microsoft Agile Capacity Model, the final
backlog items produced at the conclusion of the engagement may or may
not include the completion of all items in the product backlog
identified by the product manager. The Microsoft team will rely on the
Customer product manager to determine priority in the product backlog so
that the important backlog items specified by the Customer can be
completed during the engagement.

Customer dependencies

In addition to Customer responsibilities outlined in the EDA, the
Customer is responsible for the items noted in the following table..

| On an ongoing basis, the Customer will include           | the Pilot |
| sufficient applications in the pipeline, such that the   | and       |
| number of applications planned to be included in each    | Migrate   |
| migration wave can be achieved. Applications shall be    | phases    |
| included in the pipeline at least 60 days prior to the   |           |
| applicable migration wave month and shall include a      |           |
| buffer so that applications eliminated in the migration  |           |
| process do not cause Microsoft to have an insufficient   |           |
| application count to meet its monthly migration target.  |           |

| On an ongoing basis, the Customer will collaborate with  | all       |
| Microsoft on the migration wave planning and scheduling, | phases    |
| taking into account holidays, vacations, and other       |           |
| potential velocity obstacles.                            |           |

| The Customer will staff <number of Scale teams from OSE> |           |
| migration velocity scale teams in support of migration.  |           |
| Each team will consist of a migration coordinator and    |           |
| two migration subject matter experts (SMEs) to perform   |           |
| intake/application disposition and assessment under the  |           |
| governance of the Microsoft team. See Section 1.2.8,     |           |
| Program organization addendum, for more details.         |           |

| The Customer needs only limited effort to achieve full   |           |
| operational readiness because either (a) the Customer is |           |
| already managing Azure workloads without issue, and      |           |
| operations and governance are generally aligned to the   |           |
| Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework and using at least    |           |
| some Azure native (or other cloud native) operational    |           |
| tooling effectively; (b) the Customer has outsourced     |           |
| these functions and needs only awareness and guidance so |           |
| they can hold their supporting vendors accountable for   |           |
| using recommended practices; or (c) the migration is     |           |
| Azure VMware services-based, which limits the breadth of |           |
| changes needed to be operationally ready. Microsoft will |           |
| identify areas of risk and the Customer assumes the      |           |
| responsibility for remediating the risks during the      |           |

| The Customer has identified a team who will manage all   |           |
| organizational change management needs for the migration |           |
| of applications to Azure. This identified Customer team  |           |
| will perform the duties to mobilize key stakeholders and |           |
| will report to the Microsoft program team to engage with |           |
| the relevant business and IT stakeholders to help make   |           |
| sure that the pipeline is prepared with applications     |           |
| ready to migrate to Azure. Microsoft will identify areas |           |
