|                                                                       |
| The Leading-Edge Delivery template is for engagements (projects)      |
| intending to follow a scrum development process with a fixed          |
| capacity, fixed duration, and variable scope, in alignment with the   |
| Domains’ playbooks. If your engagement has fixed scope or fixed       |
| deliverables, or if your engagement is staff augmentation, then this  |
| is not the right template.                                            |
|                                                                       |
| This Engagement Delivery Approach (EDA) is not an exhaustive list of  |
| how we deliver agile development engagements. It is not intended to   |
| be a sales tool, nor does it instruct development teams on how to     |
| deliver engagements. The intent of this contract is to set Customer   |
| expectations on the processes for how Microsoft delivers an           |
| engagement, sets up governance, and the organizational structure used |
| during an engagement.                                                 |

Engagement delivery approach

Microsoft engagements use an agile approach based on the scrum framework
for delivery. The goal of each delivery sprint is a product increment
that can be released into production (see explanation of “product
increment” in the Definitions and acronyms section). If applicable,
Microsoft and the Customer will work together to build a repeatable
release capability with the goal of having the initial release of value
within a mutually agreeable timeline.

The Microsoft delivery approach assumes the use of Azure DevOps as a
cross-functional work planning and management tool for managing the
delivery processes defined within this document.

Sprint process

Microsoft will undertake an iterative delivery approach that is based on
a fixed-capacity, fixed-duration, variable-scope process known as the
scrum process (http://scrumguides.org). The key tenets are:

-   Joint ownership of decisions.

-   Short implementation units (sprints).

-   Prioritization of business and technical debt objectives in a
    product backlog.

-   Time-bound planning for each sprint.

-   Emphasis on the remaining work.

-   Sprints that produce a releasable product increment.

-   Sprint demonstrations that are time-restricted and have regular
    checkpoints.

-   Automation approach and pipeline strategy

-   Zero downtime deployment strategy

-   Retrospective meetings that may be used for course correction.

    [Sprint Process Moving from left to right: first a series of blocks
    representing product backlog items. To its right a smaller set of
    blocks that represent a sprint backlog list. That feeds into an
    arrow shaped like a counter clock-wise circle that has the following
    phases: Planning, Implementation, Review, and Restrospective that
    represent the sprint cycle. Spinning off of the implementation phase
    is a smaller clock-wise circle shaped arrow that represents the
    daily scrum. Near the section for the retrospective, there is a list
    of completed features. Finally on the far right of the graphic there
    is a series of blocks that have checkmarks in them representing
    completed product that has been delivered.]

At the end of each sprint, the MC and applicable Customer decision
makers will review the progress made against the objectives to determine
if any adjustments are needed using the change management process.

Engagement initiation

At the beginning of the engagement, the following tasks need to be
completed before the start of product baseline planning.

Product baseline planning

The feature team will conduct product baseline planning during a
mutually agreed-upon time frame to build out the initial product backlog
and high-level architecture. At the completion of this exercise, the
outcomes, assumptions, and dependencies will be verified.

Should there be any material deviations from the initial estimated
capacity, these and their implications will be discussed. Any changes
will be addressed through the change management process.

Defect remediation

If possible, defects found by the feature team during a delivery sprint
are fixed within the sprint itself. Defects that cannot be resolved
during the sprint will be added to the product backlog. Defects found
elsewhere will be prioritized by the MC and become part of the product
backlog.

Completion and Definition of Done

Sprints will end based on the calendar schedule defined during product
baseline planning. At the conclusion of each sprint, feature teams will
conduct a sprint review and sprint retrospective. During the sprint
review, each feature team will demonstrate completed work. At the end of
each sprint, Microsoft will provide a sprint completion report. Backlog
items do not require formal sign-off or Customer acceptance when they
are completed by the feature team.

Engagement organization

The following table shows the role descriptions and responsibilities for
each area in the engagement organization. The capacity available for
each Microsoft resource is specified in the WO. If more resource
capacity of any role is needed, it can be added through the change
management process.

Executive steering committee

The executive steering committee provides overall senior management
oversight and strategic direction for the engagement. In addition, it
removes obstacles for the engagement team. The executive steering
committee for the engagement will meet per the frequency defined in the
communication plan and will include the roles listed in the following
table. Note, a person may assume more than one role (persona).

Product council

The product council is the primary mechanism for aligning stakeholders
and dealing with competing priorities. It acts as the forum where the
strategy is agreed upon so that all key decision makers understand what
decisions are being made about the direction of the product and why. The
product council allows the feature teams to maintain autonomy while
simultaneously determining the overall priorities for business outcomes.

[]

The product council is formed to define and share the product strategy
and roadmap. It also makes decisions needed to resolve any conflicting
product priorities.

In addition to the roles listed below, all MCs and technical leads from
the individual feature teams are also members of the product council.

Feature team

Following the scrum model, Microsoft uses a feature team approach to
deliver an engagement. All scrum roles will be represented within the
feature team. This team is an autonomous and empowered unit that has all
the capabilities to design, develop, test, and release features to
achieve the Customer outcomes. A feature team consists of a MC,
technical lead, SMEs, and engineers with various development, test,
deployment, infrastructure, security, data, and operation skills.

The roles listed below are typical and representative for feature teams,
though they may differ, depending on the engagement. The skill sets of
the engineers will also be different, depending on the engagement.

Engagement governance

The governance structure and processes the team will abide by for the
engagement are described in the following sections.

Engagement communication

In addition to the communication mechanisms built into the delivery
approach, the following will be used to communicate during the
engagement:

-   Communication plan: This document will describe the frequency,
    audience, and content of communication with the team and
    stakeholders. Microsoft and the Customer will develop it as part of
    engagement planning.

-   Status reports: The Microsoft team will prepare and issue regular
    status reports to engagement stakeholders per the frequency defined
    in the communication plan.

-   Status meetings: Per the frequency defined in the communication
    plan, the Microsoft team will schedule regular status meetings to
    review the overall engagement status, available delivery data,
    delivery metrics, SLOs, SLIs, open problems, and risks.

Risk and issue management

The following general procedure will be used to manage active engagement
issues and risks during the engagement:

-   Identify: Identify and document engagement issues (current problems)
    and risks (potential events that could impact the engagement).

-   Analyze and prioritize: Assess the impact and determine the critical
    risks and issues that will be actively managed.

-   Plan and schedule: Determine how to manage critical risks and assign
    responsibility for risk management and issue resolution.

-   Track and report: Monitor and report the status of risks and issues.

-   Escalate: Escalate to engagement sponsors critical issues and risks
    the team is unable to resolve without assistance.

-   Control: Review the effectiveness of the risk and issue management
    actions.

Active issues and risks will be monitored and reassessed every week.

Change management process

During the engagement, either party may request modifications to the
services described in the WO. These changes take effect only when the
proposed change is agreed upon by both parties within a mutually
agreeable time frame. Such agreement will be captured in an amendment to
the contract, or other mutually agreeable form of documentation. No work
will begin on a change until both parties sign the agreed-upon
documentation.

Escalation path

The MCs, product council, executive sponsors, and other designees will
work closely together to manage engagement issues, risks, and change
requests as described previously. The Customer will provide reasonable
access to the sponsor or sponsors to expedite resolution. The standard
escalation path for review, approval, or dispute resolution is as
follows:

-   Feature team member

-   Migration coordinator

-   Product council

-   Executive steering committee

Customer responsibilities and engagement assumptions

Customer responsibilities

The Customer is responsible for:

-   Providing accurate, timely, and complete information within three
    business days or as mutually agreed upon.

-   Providing access to people, including knowledgeable Customer
    personnel and business users as required.

-   Providing sufficient Customer resources with the requisite skills
    for testing during the engagement.

-   Providing all requisite information to relevant external parties to
    obtain clearances for all personnel actively participating in the
    engagement, if security clearances are required.

-   Obtaining Azure subscriptions and capacity required to support the
    environments defined in the scope section of the WO.

-   Purchasing hardware, software licenses, or tools (Microsoft or
    third-party).

-   Providing a suitable work environment when onsite presence is
    required.

-   Managing all Customer personnel and vendors who are not managed by
    Microsoft.

-   Managing external dependencies for related engagements or programs.

-   Confirming regulatory compliance, if applicable.

-   Providing standard product training for external systems as
    required.

    the start of the engagement.

-   Conducting initial triaging after all releases (by the Customer
    first responder organization).

-   Providing application support.

    applications or other third-party software, hardware products, or
    applications that are not explicitly in the product backlog.

-   Preparing documentation about processes, standards, policies, and
    existing guidelines.

-   Designing, configuring, integrating, deploying, or fixing issues in
    commercially available third-party software.

-   Implementing modifications to third-party systems and external
    interfaces to support integration.

Engagement assumptions

The following are assumptions that apply to the engagement between the
Customer and Microsoft. During the engagement, the information and
assumptions in this document will be validated, and if a material
difference is present, this could result in Microsoft initiating a
change request to cover additional work or extending the engagement
duration. If a specific engagement requires different assumptions than
those listed below, that engagement may document assumptions that
supersede or override the assumptions listed below.

The following assumptions have been made for all engagements between the
Customer and Microsoft:

-   Workday:

    -   Local Microsoft employees will follow the standard Microsoft (or
          appropriate subsidiary) workday and work week.

    -   If Microsoft Global Delivery factories are used, then the
          following also apply:

    -   The standard workday for the offshore Microsoft factory team is
        between 9:30 AM and 6:30 PM India Standard Time, Monday through
        Friday, except for scheduled holidays. Limited exceptions can be
        made with advanced planning to support production-level changes
        or to address a need that requires a meeting between an offshore
        resource and the Customer, which cannot be accomplished during
        the standard workday. Exceptions will be coordinated by the
        program manager.

    -   Offshore resources that are not part of the factory will be
        available between 7 AM and 10 PM India Standard Time over an
        eight-hour continuous window.

-   Remote work:

    -   The Microsoft feature team may perform services remotely.

    -   If the Microsoft feature team is required to be present at the
          Customer location every week, resources will typically be on
          site for three nights and four days, arriving on a Monday and
          leaving on a Thursday.

    -   The place of performance under the WO may be at a Microsoft
          facility, a Customer facility, or various remote and off-site
          locations, including Microsoft employee home offices.

-   Language:

    -   All engagement communications and documentation will be in
          English. Local language support and translations will be
          provided by the Customer.

-   Staffing:

    -   If necessary, Microsoft will make staffing changes. These may
          include, but are not limited to, resources and engagement
          roles.

    -   If a security clearance is required, all resources will have the
          appropriate level of security access required to complete
          engagement-related efforts.

    -   Microsoft may staff from a global pool of resources.

-   Informal knowledge transfer:

    -   No formal training materials will be developed or delivered as
          part of this engagement. All information transfer will be
          through informal knowledge transfer.

-   Known standards:

    -   Microsoft expects to use Azure DevOps, Azure Pipelines and may
          use GitHub for a standard delivery.

    -   Time will be required to learn the Customer tooling if there are
          deviations from Microsoft standards. This time has not been
          included in engagement estimates.

    -   Microsoft will use standard Azure DevOps process templates, as
          well as other IP designed to speed up delivery, including, but
          not limited to, standard work items, pipelines, and document
          templates.

-   Other assumptions:

    -   In addition to engagement team members, the Customer shall allow
          Microsoft internal systems to access the delivery platforms
          and tools used for this engagement.

    -   Microsoft will read, store, and share necessary delivery
          insights on the work artifacts and products generated as part
          of this engagement (for example: test cases, code base, and
          pipelines) that are hosted on the delivery platforms like
          Azure DevOps, Jira and GitHub.

    -   Microsoft will make available to the Customer all data and
          insights gathered during the engagement. Microsoft will purge
          said data and insights upon explicit Customer request or at
          the end of the engagement.

    -   Holidays, vacations, and training are not factored into
          estimates.

    -   All work is to be contiguously scheduled. Any breaks in the
          engagement calendar must be scheduled four weeks in advance,
          or the time will be billed without interruption.

    -   The Customer required compliance training for regulated
          industries is not included in the estimation. This includes:

        -   Security training

        -   Internal orientation

        -   Financial compliance training

        -   Healthcare compliance training

        -   Procedures outside of Microsoft standard compliance

        -   Background checks, fingerprinting, badging, and
              authentication.

-   The Customer will meet the necessary requirements to help make sure
    the solution design meets regulatory requirements.

-   If localization support is required to support additional languages,
    it may be added to the product backlog.

-   Azure services and technology

    -   Azure services and Azure-supported Microsoft technologies will
          be used to develop the solution.

    -   The components to be developed by Microsoft will be cloud
          hosted.

    -   Microsoft will not modify any existing code base that was not
          produced by the Microsoft delivery team.

-   Azure DevOps

    -   Either the Customer will provide a Microsoft Azure DevOps
          services account that is accessible by all team members, or
          Microsoft will provide an account (possibly with limited
          Customer access).

-   The Customer agrees Microsoft may associate the Customer online
    services with Professional Services accounts through configuration
    of Customer subscriptions, Azure resources, and deployed
    applications.

-   If the Customer approves a solution design that uses a product that
    is not generally available, the Customer acknowledges and accepts
    that it may affect the engagement cost and timeline.

-   If the Customer determines that Microsoft or its agents will have
    access to personal identifiable information, the Customer is
    obligated to inform Microsoft within five days that further access
    to that information requires the use of equipment owned or supplied
    by the Customer.

-   If the engagement uses any purchased GitHub Consulting Services,
    those services are provided by GitHub, Inc., a wholly owned
    subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the
    contrary in your WO, the GitHub Privacy Statement available at
    https://aka.ms/github_privacy and the GitHub Data Protection
    Addendum and Security Exhibit located at https://aka.ms/github_dpa
    will apply to your procurement of GitHub Consulting Services.
